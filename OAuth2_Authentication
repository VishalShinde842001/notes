OAuth 2.0: Simplified Explanation
OAuth 2.0 is a framework that enables third-party applications to gain limited access to a user's resources (APIs or data) without requiring the user to share their actual login credentials. Without OAuth, sharing login credentials would give the third party complete access to all user resources. OAuth allows users to provide access to specific APIs or resources only.

Important Terms in OAuth 2.0
User:
The individual or entity who owns the resources (e.g., you).

Client:
The third-party application attempting to access the user's resources. For example, an application like Dropbox trying to access your Google Drive.

Resource Server:
The server that hosts the user's resources and APIs. For example, Google Drive is the resource server in the scenario of accessing files.
It is responsible for verifying access tokens to ensure the requesting client has valid permissions.

Authorization Server:
This server is responsible for authenticating the user and issuing tokens (access token and refresh token).

The access token contains details about the permissions granted (scope) and can only access the APIs allowed by the user.
The refresh token is used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to reauthenticate.
Depending on the implementation, access tokens can be either JWT (JSON Web Tokens), which are self-contained, or opaque tokens, which require validation from the authorization server.
Access Token:
A token provided by the authorization server that allows the client to access the user's resources from the resource server. Its lifespan is usually short for security reasons.

Refresh Token:
A token with a longer lifespan, used to generate a new access token when the current one expires. This reduces the need for repeated authentication. Refresh tokens are issued only with specific grant types, such as Authorization Code or Password Grant.

Grant Type:
A mechanism that defines how the client obtains the access token. The grant type is sent as part of the request to the authorization server. Common grant types include:

Authorization Code: For server-side apps.
Client Credentials: For machine-to-machine (M2M) communication.
Password Grant (Deprecated): For trusted apps with user-provided credentials.
Refresh Token: To generate a new access token using an existing refresh token.
Redirect URI:
The URL to which the authorization server redirects the user after the user grants or denies permissions. This URI must exactly match the one registered during client application setup to prevent malicious redirections.

Client ID and Client Secret:
These are the credentials issued to the client (third-party app) when registering the application with the authorization server.

Client ID: Public identifier for the client.
Client Secret: Confidential key shared between the client and the authorization server. Note that public clients like SPAs and mobile apps may not use a client secret for security reasons.
State:
A random string sent with the request to the authorization server and returned with the response. It helps prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks by ensuring the response corresponds to the original request.

Scope:
Specifies the level of access the client is requesting. For example, it could request permissions like read, write, or view. Scopes may also define access to specific API endpoints or granular levels of data.

Response Type:
Indicates the type of response expected from the authorization server. For example:

code: For the Authorization Code flow.
token: For the Implicit flow (deprecated).
Code Verifier:
A random string generated at the client-side in the PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange) flow. It is sent along with the request for an access token.

Code Challenge:
A hashed version of the code verifier using a specific hashing technique (e.g., SHA256). It is sent to the authorization server during the initial request.

Code Challenge Method:
The hashing method used to generate the code challenge from the code verifier. For example, it could be S256 for SHA256 hashing.

Additional Notes
The Implicit Grant is now considered deprecated due to security risks and has been replaced by Authorization Code Grant with PKCE for public clients.
Tokens issued by the authorization server must be transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception.
OAuth 2.0 also supports machine-to-machine communication using the Client Credentials Grant, which does not involve user authentication.
Access token formats may vary:
JWT: Self-contained tokens with encoded permissions, user information, and expiration.
Opaque Tokens: Require validation using the authorization server’s introspection endpoint.
Error Handling: OAuth responses include error codes like invalid_grant, invalid_scope, and access_denied, which should be appropriately handled by clients.

Authorization Code Grant Type (with PKCE for public clients)
Step 1: Authorization Request
The client (third-party application) redirects the user to the Authorization Server's authorization endpoint.

The request includes the following parameters:

response_type=code: Indicates that the client expects an authorization code in the response.
client_id: The unique identifier for the client application (registered with the authorization server).
redirect_uri: The URI where the authorization server will send the user after they authorize the request.
scope: The permissions or access level being requested (e.g., read, write).
state: A random string to prevent CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attacks and ensure the response corresponds to the request.
Result: The user is prompted to log in (if not already logged in) and authorize the client. Upon approval, the authorization server redirects the user to the redirect_uri with an authorization code.
code_challege(PKCE): if you are using the pkce grant type then will simply need to send code challege and code_challege method which wil usefull for future validation of code_verifier
code_challenge_method : It is simply method which was used to encrypt code_verifier

Example: https://client.com/callback?code=authorization_code&state=random_state
Step 2: Access Token Request
The client sends a POST request to the authorization server's token endpoint to exchange the authorization code for an access token.

The request includes the following parameters:

grant_type=authorization_code: Specifies that the client is using the Authorization Code grant type.
code: The authorization code received from the authorization server in Step 1.
redirect_uri: The same redirect URI used in the authorization request.
client_id: The client’s ID (same as in Step 1).
client_secret: The client’s secret (only needed for confidential clients).
code_verifier (if using PKCE): The code verifier (generated by the client before the initial request) to ensure the integrity of the request.
Result: The authorization server validates the authorization code and, if valid, returns an access token (and optionally a refresh token).

Example response:
json
Copy code
{
  "access_token": "access_token_value",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,  // Access token expiry time in seconds
  "refresh_token": "refresh_token_value"  // Optional, if the grant supports it
}
Step 3: Access Protected Resources
The client can now use the access token to make API requests to the resource server.
The access token is included in the request header as a Bearer token:
makefile
Copy code
Authorization: Bearer access_token_value
The resource server verifies the token, and if valid, returns the requested resource.
Step 4: Token Expiration and Refresh (Optional, if the client is provided with a refresh token)
When the access token expires, the client can use the refresh token (if available) to request a new access token without needing to reauthorize the user.

The client sends a POST request to the token endpoint with the following parameters:

grant_type=refresh_token: Indicates that the client is using a refresh token to get a new access token.
refresh_token: The refresh token obtained earlier.
client_id and client_secret: The client credentials.
Result: The authorization server returns a new access token (and optionally a new refresh token).

Summary of Key Parameters:
Authorization Request (Step 1):

response_type=code
client_id
redirect_uri
scope
state
Token Request (Step 2):

grant_type=authorization_code
code
redirect_uri
client_id
client_secret
code_verifier (if using PKCE)
API Request (Step 3):

Authorization: Bearer access_token
Refresh Token Request (Step 4):

grant_type=refresh_token
refresh_token
client_id
client_secret
This flow is secure because the authorization code is exchanged on the server side (not exposed to the user agent or browser), and the use of PKCE for public clients adds additional security by ensuring that the authorization request is linked to the token request.

Grant Type: Client Credentials
The Client Credentials Grant is used for machine-to-machine (M2M) authentication, where no user is involved. It's used by clients (backend services or applications) that need to authenticate and access resources on their behalf, not on behalf of a user.

Step-by-Step Flow of Client Credentials Grant:
Request Access Token:
The client authenticates itself by sending a POST request to the Authorization Server's token endpoint, including:

grant_type=client_credentials
client_id (assigned during registration)
client_secret (secret key for authentication)
Authorization Server Validates:
The server checks the client_id and client_secret. If valid, it grants an access token along with metadata like token type and expiration.

Access Resource:
The client uses the access token to make authenticated requests to the Resource Server, including it in the Authorization header.

Example Request to Obtain Access Token:
http
Copy code
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials
&client_id=your_client_id
&client_secret=your_client_secret
Example Response from Authorization Server:
json
Copy code
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600
}
Using the Access Token to Access Resources:
http
Copy code
GET /protected-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: resource-server.com
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
Security Considerations:
No User Involvement: No user credentials are involved; this is for server-to-server communication.
Client Secrets: Keep client_secret secure. If compromised, attackers could impersonate the client.
Short-lived Tokens: Access tokens are usually short-lived and can be refreshed as needed.
Scope: The client may specify the scope of access in the request to limit what the token can access.

Grant Type: Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant (Password Grant)
The Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant is used when the client application has direct access to the user's credentials (username and password). This grant type is typically used in situations where the client is a trusted application, such as a first-party mobile app or a web app where the user directly enters their credentials.

Step-by-Step Flow of Password Grant:
User Provides Credentials:
The user provides their username and password directly to the client application (e.g., mobile app or web app).

Request Access Token:
The client then sends a POST request to the Authorization Server's token endpoint, including:

grant_type=password
client_id (the client identifier)
client_secret (the secret key)
username (user's credentials)
password (user's password)
Authorization Server Validates:
The Authorization Server verifies the username and password. If valid, it returns an access token and an optional refresh token.

Access Resource:
The client uses the access token to access resources on the Resource Server. It sends the token in the Authorization header of the request.

Example Request to Obtain Access Token:
http
Copy code
POST /token HTTP/1.1
Host: authorization-server.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=password
&client_id=your_client_id
&client_secret=your_client_secret
&username=user_username
&password=user_password
Example Response from Authorization Server:
json
Copy code
{
  "access_token": "your_access_token",
  "token_type": "bearer",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "refresh_token": "your_refresh_token"
}
Using the Access Token to Access Resources:
http
Copy code
GET /protected-resource HTTP/1.1
Host: resource-server.com
Authorization: Bearer your_access_token
Security Considerations:
Sensitive Credentials: This grant type involves transmitting the user's username and password to the client application, so it is recommended only in highly trusted environments (e.g., first-party apps).
Limited Use: It's generally less secure than other OAuth2 grant types, like Authorization Code, because it exposes user credentials to the client application.
Client Secrets: Ensure that the client_secret is kept secure and is only shared between the client application and the Authorization Server.
Short-lived Tokens: The access token should be short-lived, and a refresh token can be used to obtain a new access token without re-entering credentials.
When to Use Resource Owner Password Credentials Grant:
Trusted Applications: Suitable for trusted applications (e.g., first-party mobile apps or websites) where the user willingly provides their username and password.
Low-Risk Scenarios: Use when the risks of exposing the user's credentials are low, and the client application is highly trusted.
